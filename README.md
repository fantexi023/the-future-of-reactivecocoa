The Future of ReactiveCocoa
===========================

Presentation for [RACDC 2014](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/issues/1350), built for [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/).

If you just want the rendered slides, check out the PDF. Unfortunately, it doesn't include presenters' notes, so you may want to read the raw Markdown.

You can see the video of this talk [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICNjRS2X8WM&list=PL0lo9MOBetEEXnrrP5pwZxSkGvaDBGdOC&index=2). It may be worth watching, as it includes some discussion that wasn't in the prepared presentation!
